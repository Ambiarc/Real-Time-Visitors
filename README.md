# reelyActive & Ambiarc Integration

[Hosted Demo Link](http://ambiarc.com)

This project demonstrates integration of a reelyActive websockets data feed (using [beaver.js](https://github.com/reelyactive/beaver)) into an indoor Ambiarc map. This project maps the Notman House, a technology and startup hub in Montreal, Quebec. The data is real-time and shows active visitors in the building. 

To run the project with live data, you'll need to add a reelyActive API key to the config.js file. The demo links shows full functionality.
